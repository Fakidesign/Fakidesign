- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Fakidesign
Thank you for checking my profile,here is a quick overview of my skills and opportunities.Primarily 
I am organized,responsible and motivated.I am currently working for a couple of organizations (esport) as their GFX 
designer to create various tables, logos, thumbnail banners, etc...I also worked for various clients who needed a logo for different types of jobs.

I also worked for a couple of months in the editorial office of the city portal, but I didn't really find myself in that. I also know how to work with WEB pages (html, css, js, wp, php).So far I have designed 30+ logos, 20+ banners, 70+ tables but you have more in my portfolio.

Programs: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro.

I am currently a student at the Technical Faculty in BihaÄ‡. Department of Electrical Engineering / Informatics.

My current goal is to satisfy as many clients as possible and fulfill the requirements.
